# Project Name

Weekend-Redux-Feedback-Loop

## Description

This app took a weekend to build.
This is an app that allows users to submit feedback based on how they are feeling, how they are understanding the material they are learning, and how they feel they are being supported.  They can also leave additional comments.  The information is stored on a database which sends it to an admin page.

Here is how you can get this up and running on your own machine:

Create a database named "prime_feedback"
The queries in the data.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
